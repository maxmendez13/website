	<h2>Hobbies + Extras</h2>
	<p>I like keeping myself busy with many hobbies! Some of these include crocheting + knitting, listening to music, drawing, painting, playing video games, watching movies, reading, writing, and eating good food! Here are some specifics if you are interested, q&a style:</p>
	
	<h4>You know both crocheting and knitting?</h4>
	<p>Yes I do! I learned how to crochet first in 2021 and in 2023 is when I officially committed to knitting. I own a crochet business with my friend called <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mixedmarvelousmakes/">Mixed Marvelous Makes</a></i> where we mostly sell crochet plushies, various other crocheted items, and stickers!</p>
	
	<h4>What genres of music do you listen to? Who's your favorite artist?</h4>
	<p>My favorite artist right now is <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Dont_Know_How_But_They_Found_Me">I Don't Know How But They Found Me</a></i>, a band from Salt Lake City led by Dallon Weekes. Some genres I listen to are indie pop, pop punk, rock, alternative, pop, metal.</p>
	
	<h4>What is your favorite painting you've ever made?</h4>
	<p>I mostly draw or paint video game related images but sometimes I switch things up. In July 2024 I painted a biblical inspired painting of Chucky, Tiffany, and Glen/Glenda from the <i>Child's Play</i> franchise.</p>
	
	<h4>What kind of movies do you like?</h4>
	<p>I enjoy horror! I like others as well and I'm receptive to most genres but as of the past few years I've been really into horror such as <i>Hellraiser</i>, <i>Child's Play</i>, and <i>Killer Klowns from Outer Space</i>. My favorite movie of all time is <i>Heathers</i>.</p>
	
	<h4>What was the last book you've read for leisure?</h4>
	<p>I read a lot for my university classes but the last book I read for my own enjoyment was <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Came_from_the_Closet:_Queer_Reflections_on_Horror">It Came from the Closet: Queer Reflections on Horror</a></i>.</p>
	
	<h4>What do you write?</h4>
	<p>I don't write anywhere else normally except for my journal. I used to hate writing for English classes growing up but since taking a creative writing class in my Freshman year of college I have grown to appreciate it. Writing is an important skill and I try to find ways to make it engaging for me.</p>
	
	<h4>What are your favorite cuisines?</h4>
	<p>I like a lot of food but my top 3 are probably Chinese Sichuan, Mexican, and Cuban. I really like spicy food and my favorite dish is 麻辣火锅 (pronounced málà  huǒguò) and it is a spicy dry hotpot dish. I grew up eating a lot of Cuban food so it has a lot of nostalgia points, although not spicy.</p>
